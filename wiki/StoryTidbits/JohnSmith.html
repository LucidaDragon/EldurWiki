"Welcome to Centrum. How can I help you reach your destination today?"<br>

John opened his eyes.<br>

The friendly face of a female travel agent stared back at him.<br>

"Can I interest you in one of our more popular destinations this quarter?"<br>

He groaned. Clearly there had been a mistake. He'd fallen asleep on the job again, and now he was here.<br>

"I'm sorry ma'am, but it appears I am not supposed to be here. I'll be going now."<br>

He tapped his bracelet and activated his holographic keyboard and screen, typing a command into the system prompt.<br>

<div class="console">
	<p>jsmith@console&gt; exit</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Error: Insufficient privledges.</p>
</div>

He was hit with sudden shock. No, this couldn't be right.<br>

<div class="console">
<p>jsmith@console&gt; exit --force</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error: Insufficient privledges.</p>
</div>

The travel agent was starting to look at him strange. He didn't like it. He had no idea where he was. He decided to make good on his promise in a different way and left the travel agency out the front entrance, walking out into what looked very similar to a train terminal. He kept typing on his keyboard in a panic.<br>

<div class="console">
	<p>jsmith@console&gt; permlevel</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Permission level for jsmith@console:</p>
	<p>Previously "sysadmin", currently &lt;null&gt;.</p>
	<p>Last updated 2 hours ago.</p>
</div>

His permissions to use the system were gone. He had no idea how that could have happened. He looked at the world around him. There were a few people walking around, nothing super out of the ordinary. He went and sat down on a bench so he could focus. He needed to get out of here, somehow, but something wasn't right.<br>

<div class="console">
	<p>jsmith@console> history</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Previously issued commands:</p>
	<p>history (0 seconds ago)</p>
	<p>permlevel (47 seconds ago)</p>
	<p>exit --force (1 minute ago)</p>
	<p>exit (1 minute ago)</p>
	<p>Error: Unexpected end of stream.</p>
</div>

He couldn't even look at his full command history. He had to stop himself from typing any more commands. He was going to go crazy if he found something else that wasn't working. This was already the worst case scenario. He needed to calm himself and think... If he couldn't pull himself out, maybe he could get one of the other admins to do it for him.<br>

<div class="console">
	<p>jsmith@console&gt; wall "Can someone send an exit command for me? My perms are all gone and I can't do it myself."</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>BROADCAST 831319465: Can someone send an exit command for me? My perms are all gone and I can't do it myself.</p>
</div>

He waited, praying and watching the screen. After five minutes he was starting to lose hope, but then the screen scrolled and his eyes refocused in a rush of hope.<br>

<div class="console">
	<p>BROADCAST 831319465: Can someone send an exit command for me? My perms are all gone and I can't do it myself.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>SYSTEM: Unauthorized broacasts are against the terms of service. Continued abuse will result in termination.</p>
</div>

There's nobody out there that could even hear him. He cursed and closed his holographic display, getting up and heading back to the travel agency. The travel agent was still sitting at her desk. He returned to the seat he'd found himself in previously. She immediatly looked up and greeted him with the same line.<br>

"Welcome to Centr-"<br>

He cut her off.<br>

"Where am I exactly?"<br>

"You are in the Centrum Exchange Center."<br>

"A few minutes ago... how did I get here?"<br>

"You appeared in the chair you are currently sitting in."<br>

"Is it normal for people to just appear in front of you like that?"<br>

"Yes, all of our clients appear in these chairs."<br>

"So you are aware you are in a simulation?"<br>

"A what?"<br>

"Are you aware that you are not real?"<br>

"I'm afraid I don't understand what you're saying."<br>

"So you don't kno- you know what, nevermind. Do you have an explaination for why people appear in these chairs?"<br>

"People show up if they're trying to travel somewhere."<br>

"Where do they come from?"<br>

"All kinds of places. There's really too many to list."<br>

"Give me an example."<br>

"Well, the customer before you was coming from a place that's entirely full of water."<br>

"And where did they go?"<br>

"They were going to an infinite junkyard to collect scrap components."<br>

"Are you aware of what these places are?"<br>

"I'm not sure what you mean. They're places."<br>

"Right... and how do people go between these places exactly?"<br>

"Arcways between the two places."<br>

He paused. This finally sounded like something promising.<br>

"Excuse me... arcways?"<br>

"Allow me to show you, since everyone seems to have a different term for them. You might recognize them seeing as they're a required component of coming here in the first place."<br>

She got up from her chair and walked out into the lobby area. He followed her, walking past the benches and over to the banks of turnstiles at the far end. She stopped there and turned on her heel to face him.<br>

"Just over there you can see them. They're like a doorway if you will."<br>

He watched the so-called arcways humming away on the other side of the turnstiles. They were each roughly shaped like an arch, and had a similarly shaped interior that appeared to glow. At first it seemed simple enough, but then he noticed the edge between the glow and the actual arch. It was hard to see from this distance, but they actually seemed to be tearing the space around it. He watched as horror filled his mind at the realization of what it actually was. A portal between simulations using exploits in the DSPPU physics calculations. Essentially... glitches of the worst kind right in front of him. Apparently someone somewhere figured out how to abuse them to violate cross-simulation interaction policy, and now it was being abused across at least a few of the simulations to travel between them. His brain was about to shut off entirely, but then he realized something. As horrifying as these exploits were, maybe the person who figured them out could help him get out of here.<br>

"Where can I find the person who invented these?"<br>

"Funny that you ask, he actually just passed through here a few hours ago. He was going on a vacation to a place with lots of beaches."<br>

"How much would it cost for me to go there?"<br>

"Oh, first round-trip is free of charge. Would you like me to set that up for you?"<br>

"Yes, please... Oh, and what's his name?"<br>

"He has a few nicknames, but he travels under the name Melior."<br>
