Jade is a patient dragoness who is considered affectionate and generous by her fellow dragons. She takes pride in having grown the forest beyond the [DragonValley], and wishes she could do the same in [Liminal].
# Childhood
Jade was born during [TheBirthOfDragons] along with the rest of the draconic gods. As she learned to use her powers over plants and fungi, she took to using them to maintain the fields of the [DragonValley] and grow the lush forests beyond.
# Adulthood
Jade was killed during [TheBirthOfNix] when Nix made his first attack on the dragons. Thanks to the presence of [Godith], her soul was able to return to the [Dream] plane and reincarnate within [Liminal]. Upon awakening in Liminal she found that she had lost her powers. She remained in Liminal for the rest of her existence, forever exploring the infinite spaces of the plane.
