Nix is the pure draconic god of destruction. He appears to be similar to the dragons born of [Godith]. Despite this, his unexplained appearance, unique abilities, murder of Godith, and hatred of other dragons has earned him the title of "The Anti-Dragon".

# Abilities
Nix has an aura that causes dragon magic to be absorbed and nullified. The range of his aura is directly effected by the amount of power he can absorb, which can lead to a snowballing effect as his aura expands. He is also rendered physically invulnerable by the [Permium] that his body is made of.
