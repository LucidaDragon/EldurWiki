# Personality
Myra is an extroverted dragoness that is considered articulate and intelligent by those she meets. She takes pride in having a strong moral compass and understanding the complexity of cultural backgrounds that each person possesses.
# Childhood
Myra was born during [ThePermanentAge]. She came close to death before hatching, but was saved when [Willseeker] gave part of his soul to keep her alive. He subsequently stole her egg from the royal hatchery and raised her as his own so that she would not have to live under the queen's influence. She became an avid reader of the scrolls that her adoptive father brought back to her whenever he returned from his trips to the queendoms. Unfortunately for Myra, he had a strong belief that the queen would come looking for both of them and forbade her from leaving their hidden cave without him watching over her.
# Adulthood
After Myra got caught sneaking out of the cave, an argument between [Willseeker] and her resulted in them coming to an agreement that she was now old enough to be able to take care of herself. She continued to live with her adoptive father but began visiting the queendoms to experience the culture for herself. Her life was abruptly interrupted when [Nix] came and killed Willseeker. When [Techa] came looking for Nix, she joined them to avenge her adoptive father's death.
