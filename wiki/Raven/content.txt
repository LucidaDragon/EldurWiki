# Appearance
Raven has an eerie black body and an iron gray belly. His membrane wings are midnight black and speckled with blue-white dots, while his horns and talons are white. These dots often move independently of the membrane itself, making them disorientating to look at up close. Raven has cornflower blue eyes and horns that match the color of his belly.
# Abilities
Raven can cause another being he is conversing with to form a resentment of the currently established cultural norms. This can also lead to them projecting their own problems onto the norms, which can leave a permanent change in the being's behaviour and personality.
# Personality
Raven is a daring dragon who is perceived as driven but spiteful by his fellow dragons. He resents the royal hierarchy while simultaneously struggling to supress a deep urge to gather power of his own.
# Childhood
Raven was born during [TheCrossroadsAge] to [Naeora], an outpost guard in the queendom of [Zeline]. She kept the birth a secret for as long as she could, but once Raven hatched he was almost immediately discovered and sent to live in the queendom's main settlement, away from his mother. He spent most of his childhood being raised by [Orfneh], the queen's vice martial, who considered him more of a burden than a gift despite having wanted a child of her own. This did not deter her from trying to turn him into the best soldier in the queendom, though she failed to get Raven to show any interest in it.
Raven's abilities started to develop later than the majority of dragons, which caused many to think that he simply had no abilities at all. This was quickly proven wrong however, as during a training session with several other soldiers in training he made a few offhand comments about his dislike for the queen that then snowballed into a small militia forming and plotting to overthrow the queen. They were discovered by [Orfneh], who had heard rumors of traitorous soldiers. When she learned that Raven had been responsible she vowed to double her efforts of making him the queen's perfect soldier. Her first act after this vow was to force him to stand nose to nose with, and look into the eyes of, each dragon that had been caught as they were executed for traitorous conspiracy.
The next several years of Raven's life were almost entirely entirely dedicated to being shamed and emaciated for what he had caused, the majority of the harassment coming from [Orfneh] herself, who saw it as the only path to his redemption. This had the opposite effect that she wanted however, and Raven's disdain for the royal hierarchy quickly turned to hatred. This culminated in him running away, more content to struggle to survive on his own than continue to receive Orfneh's treatment. He came incredibly close to starvation, being forced to crawl across the ground because he couldn't support his own weight, until he came across a clearing where he found [Willseeker] standing over two other dragons he had just murdered. Raven's starvation forced him to ignore Willseeker however and he instead began cannibalizing one of the bodies in front of him. This amused Willseeker, who then chose to spare him in favour of making him into another pawn.
# Adulthood
Raven began traveling with [Willseeker] and started helping him with his quest to topple the queendoms. Raven's goal was to become a king once the plans were complete so that he could make all of the decisions that the queens weren't making. He began seeing Willseeker as a mentor of sorts, a kind of connection he had never felt with [Orfneh], which served to bias his judgement in Willseeker's favour whenever a decision needed to be made.
When Willseeker was finally captured by the mages hunting him, Raven debated whether he wanted to free him or move on with his life. He chose to free him, on the condition that Willseeker helped him become king. Willseeker initially agreed with his demands, only to have him set up and captured a few days later. Raven then spent several years in a royal prison, enough time to realize the he had been used and led astray. By the time he managed to escape he no longer desired to be king, instead wanting to simply live a life of his own. He traveled between the queendoms, doing odd jobs and never staying in one place for too long, content to just watch the world happen around him.
