Willseeker is a mortal dragon who was possessed by the soul of [Nix] at a young age. His possession granted him a subset of Nix's powers, which he used to make multiple attempts at overthrowing the royal hierarchies of the [Drekii]. His attempts eventually lead to him meeting Myra, who he adopted and raised before his death at the hands of Nix.

# Appearance
Willseeker has a predominantly dark purple body with several bright purple burn marks across his legs, tail, and belly. His wings are dotted by tiny white reflective flecks that resemble the night sky when viewed from a distance.
# Abilities
Willseeker gained several abilities from begin possessed by [Nix], the most prominent being his ability to become ethereal when in shadow. This allows him to become immaterial and rapidly move between any surface connected by shadow. His etherealness can not be maintained when exposed to bright light or when the shadows he is using are removed.
# Personality
Before the accident that befell him and his siblings, Willseeker was an intelligent and creative young dragon. He often took to looking through scrolls rather than playing games, even though he had never been taught how to read. Following the accident and years of torture that most of his childhood involved, his emotions would swing wildly between being manipulative and being aggressive. He treated other dragons as below him, even when they were his supposed ally, and felt no moral quandary in killing if he thought it would aid in the downfall of the royalty. Upon meeting [Myra] for the first time, he had a shift in perspective that forced him to rethink his goals of overthrowing the royalty. Raising her slowly healed the mental wounds that had afflicted him for so long, eventually returning him to the dragon he had once been.
# Childhood
Willseeker was born during [TheEnlightenmentAge] to a family of royal guards. They treated him and his five brothers and sisters with disdain, often locking their children away in storage rooms so they could go about serving the queen uninterrupted. This habit, although effective, eventually lead to an unfortunate accident when one of the young dragons dislodged a stone holding back a pocket of magma buried in the volcanic walls of the palace. The resulting torrent of lava killed all five of Willseeker's siblings and left him permanently scarred by large burn marks across his body. This traumatic event occurred at the same time that [Nix's Amulet] was broken, attracting Nix's soul to possess its new found host. While doctors were tending to Willseeker they saw that he briefly showed signs of turning ethereal. They immediately began theorizing what could have happened to cause it, but had few ideas.
The royal high mage, who was attending to unrelated matters at the hospital, took special note of Willseeker's condition. Being a young dragon, it was expected that Willseeker's parents would eventually come to claim him, but after several days and a short campaign by the doctors to find his parents, nobody came looking for him. The high mage decided to take advantage of this and claimed to be his guardian. All of this occurred while Willseeker was still unconscious, and it was only when he was healed and awoken by his new adopted father that he learned of the events that had transpired since the accident.
The royal mage had little care for Willseeker's traumatic experience as he was more concerned with the strange ethereal powers that had manifested because of it. He began doing experiments on Willseeker to test what his abilities could and could not do and, because he had a rather sadistic disposition, this often involved torturing Willseeker with various means until he passed out, only to be healed again minutes later so he could resume being experimented with. These near daily experiment sessions and constant imprisonment lasted for the majority of Willseeker's childhood, until the day that he unintentionally called upon Nix's destructive rage, killing the mage and eviscerating his corpse in the process. Willseeker then fled from the palace and into the wilderness, knowing what would happen to him if it was discovered he had killed the royal high mage.
# Adulthood
Having fled the palace, Willseeker suddenly found that his first days of freedom were filled with hunger. He had initially considered his abilities to be something evil cast upon him by the royal mage, but as he was driven to near starvation he was forced to use them to fend for himself. It was not long before he decided to turn his hatred for what he had become towards the royal hierarchies of the world, whom he considered to be at the root cause of his problems. After regaining his strength, he began constructing a plan to bring about their end.
He traveled to the southern-most queendom, that of Queen [Delesti], and began listening to private conversations from the shadows. He targeted notable figures in the royal hierarchy and collected pieces of information that they would not want to be made public, which was easily accomplished thanks to the rampant corruption within the nobles vying for power beneath the queen. He then dropped small notes at their homes, blackmailing them into giving him influence over their decisions. He continued doing this with significant dragons across the queendom until he had enough influence to arrange for an audience with the queen.
He informed her that he was a former spy from the north who had decided to betray Queen [Verismi] after he had learned that she was planning to start a war. Delesti did not immediately trust his word, but she did choose to order some of her outpost forces to return to her palace to ensure it was properly fortified. This was what Willseeker had been hoping for and used the remainder of his influence over the political underlings to send a seemingly legitimate royal message to Verismi. In it, he declared war against her queendom on behalf of Delesti. The subsequent build-up of Verismi’s forces confirmed Delesti's worries and solidified her trust in Willseeker. From that point forward he was offered a seat at the royal high table, where he slowly convinced the nobles to push for more territory as the war progressed, leaving Verismi’s infrastructure destroyed in the process.
While the war raged on between the two queendoms, Willseeker began the process of collecting influence again, this time in the queendom of Zeline. It was during this time that he met [Raven], who provided valuable information that allowed him to gain a trusted position next to the Queen. Zeline already wished to reclaim the land that had been taken from her previously, but the information that Willseeker fed to her was enough for her to realize her ambitions and enter the war while it was still raging instead of waiting for the other queendoms to exhaust themselves, believing that the other queendoms had less resources than they really did.
As the third queendom entered the war, Willseeker decided to return to Delesti with Raven by his side to ensure his influence was not lost over the Queen. On the return journey he was captured by mages who were the former underlings of the high mage that had tortured him in his youth. They had been tracking him since the day he had escaped, using the high mage’s notes as a guide. He was then imprisoned in a magic chest, leaving him with no choice but to wait and see if Raven would come to free him or if the mages would let him go.
Raven did eventually come to free him but gave him an ultimatum. He was to either help Raven become king once the war was over or remain captured forever. He agreed and Raven believed his word, but when they arrived at the queendom of Delesti he hastily sent a letter to Zeline informing her that he had found a former traitor of hers. He then told Raven that there was an important contact on the borders between the two queendoms and sent him to meet with them. When he arrived he only found Zeline’s forces waiting for him. He was captured and imprisoned, allowing Willseeker to go about his business unimpeded.
When he returned to Queen Delesti’s high table he found that she was acting much colder towards him than before. After several attempts to persuade her on various matters in the war, he got a sense that something wasn’t right and attempted to leave. He was stopped by Verismi’s mages, who had managed to reach Delesti before him and inform her of what his true past was. They attempted to capture him once more, but were ill-prepared to be attempting to recapture him so soon. He killed two of them before fleeing the queendom as the news spread that the Queens had been tricked and the war subsided.
Three of the largest queendoms were now unified in the aftermath of Willseeker’s deception while he was left living in fear of being found by the mages. The thought that he would fail to bring an end to the queendoms after all he had done drove him into a paranoid madness. He determined that the only thing he could do was murder the royal offspring of each of the Queens before he could be captured. He then returned to Verismi’s queendom to carry out his plan to break into the royal hatchery and destroy all of the eggs.
When Willseeker arrived he chose to break in through the rear of the hatchery, slipping in through the slits in the exterior walls that were meant for ventilation. This end of the hatchery was reserved for eggs that were weak, flawed, or not expected to hatch. It was here where Willseeker discovered [Myra]’s egg and witnessed her perishing. This event not only broke his spell of paranoid madness but also completely changed his perspective on the world. He split his soul to save her, and subsequently stole her egg so that she would not be subjected to a life of being one of Verismi’s many princesses.
Willseeker spent the rest of his years raising Myra away from the queendoms, finally managing to smother the hatred Nix’s soul radiated under his love for her. Eventually, the unfortunate day came when Nix came to take his soul back, killing Willseeker in the process and causing Myra to join [Techa] to avenge her adoptive father's death.
